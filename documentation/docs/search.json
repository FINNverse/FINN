    "text": "Preface\nMachine learning (ML) is the process of building a predictive model that makes predictions about new data based on observations (training data). The goal of this course is to enable you to build a robust ML model, one that generalizes well to new observations and doesn’t “overfit” your training data. To do this, you will need to master a number of skills, in particular\nIn recent years, a new field within ML called Deep Learning has emerged and attracted a lot of attention. The reason for this is that DL incorporates many different but very flexible architectures that allow to natively model different types of data, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks for images or Recurrent Neural Networks for time series. However, exploiting the flexibility of DL requires a deeper, more fundamental understanding of the frameworks in which they are implemented. To this end, the course will also cover common DL frameworks such as TensorFlow (and PyTorch) and:"
