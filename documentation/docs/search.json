It main purpose is to understand the limitations and potentials of dynamic forest models in a changing world. A key element of FINN is the interface between classic processes based modeling and data driven machine learning techniques.\nAuthors:\nMaximilian Pichler: @_Max_Pichler\nYannek Käber: @KaberYannek\nContributors:\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License"

In 1972 Botkin introduced the first forest gap model Jabowa (Botkin, Janak, and Wallis 1972), which was followed by a range of many models that are all based on same principles (Bugmann and Seidl 2022). Thus, over 50 years of model development led to a large range of forest models that are used to study forest ecosystems in various ways.\nThe fundamental idea of a Forest Gap Model is to simulate forest succession on independent patches. Multiple stochastic realizations of forest succession trajectories lead to stable average estimates of forest structure (biomass, species, composition, size distribution). The number of patches is determined by the scale of the models application. Within these basic principles a range of models implement the idea of forest succession in different ways."
