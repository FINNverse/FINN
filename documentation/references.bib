	abstract = {Geographically extensive forest inventories, such as the {USDA} Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis ({FIA}) program, contain millions of individual tree growth and mortality records that could be used to develop broad-scale models of forest dynamics. A limitation of inventory data, however, is that individual-level measurements of light (L) and other environmental factors are typically absent. Thus, inventory data alone cannot be used to parameterize mechanistic models of forest dynamics in which individual performance depends on light, water, nutrients, etc. To overcome this limitation, we developed methods to estimate species-specific parameters (θG) relating sapling growth (G) to L using data sets in which G, but not L, is observed for each sapling. Our approach involves: (1) using calibration data that we collected in both eastern and western North America to quantify the probability that saplings receive different amounts of light, conditional on covariates x that can be obtained from inventory data (e.g., sapling crown class and neighborhood crowding); and (2) combining these probability distributions with observed G and x to estimate θG using Bayesian computational methods. Here, we present a test case using a data set in which G, L, and x were observed for saplings of nine species. This test data set allowed us to compare estimates of θG obtained from the standard approach (where G and L are observed for each sapling) to our method (where G and x, but not L, are observed). For all species, estimates of θG obtained from analyses with and without observed L were similar. This suggests that our approach should be useful for estimating light-dependent growth functions from inventory data that lack direct measurements of L. Our approach could be extended to estimate parameters relating sapling mortality to L from inventory data, as well as to deal with uncertainty in other resources (e.g., water or nutrients) or environmental factors (e.g., temperature).},

	abstract = {Abstract. Canopy radiative transfer is the primary mechanism by which models relate vegetation composition and state to the surface energy balance, which is important to light- and temperature-sensitive plant processes as well as understanding land–atmosphere feedbacks.
In addition, certain parameters (e.g., specific leaf area, {SLA}) that have an outsized influence on vegetation model behavior can be constrained by observations of shortwave reflectance, thus reducing model predictive uncertainty.
Importantly, calibrating against radiative transfer outputs allows models to directly use remote sensing reflectance products without relying on highly derived products (such as {MODIS} leaf area index) whose assumptions may be incompatible with the target vegetation model and whose uncertainties are usually not well quantified.
Here, we created the {EDR} model by coupling the two-stream representation of canopy radiative transfer in the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 ({ED}2) with a leaf radiative transfer model ({PROSPECT}-5) and a simple soil reflectance model to predict full-range, high-spectral-resolution surface reflectance that is dependent on the underlying {ED}2 model state.
We then calibrated this model against estimates of hemispherical reflectance (corrected for directional effects) from the {NASA} Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer ({AVIRIS}) and survey data from 54 temperate forest plots in the northeastern United States.
The calibration significantly reduced uncertainty in model parameters related to leaf biochemistry and morphology and canopy structure for five plant functional types.
Using a single common set of parameters across all sites, the calibrated model was able to accurately reproduce surface reflectance for sites with highly varied forest composition and structure.
However, the calibrated model's predictions of leaf area index ({LAI}) were less robust, capturing only 46 \% of the variability in the observations.
Comparing the {ED}2 radiative transfer model with another two-stream soil–leaf–canopy radiative transfer model commonly used in remote sensing studies ({PRO}4SAIL) illustrated structural errors in the {ED}2 representation of direct radiation backscatter that resulted in systematic underestimation of reflectance.
In addition, we also highlight that, to directly compare with a two-stream radiative transfer model like {EDR}, we had to perform an additional processing step to convert the directional reflectance estimates of {AVIRIS} to hemispherical reflectance (also known as “albedo”).
In future work, we recommend that vegetation models add the capability to predict directional reflectance, to allow them to more directly assimilate a wide range of airborne and satellite reflectance products.
We ultimately conclude that despite these challenges, using dynamic vegetation models to predict surface reflectance is a promising avenue for model calibration and validation using remote sensing data.},

	abstract = {Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to extract patterns and insights from the ever-increasing stream of geospatial data, but current approaches may not be optimal when system behaviour is dominated by spatial or temporal context. Here, rather than amending classical machine learning, we argue that these contextual cues should be used as part of deep learning (an approach that is able to extract spatio-temporal features automatically) to gain further process understanding of Earth system science problems, improving the predictive ability of seasonal forecasting and modelling of long-range spatial connections across multiple timescales, for example. The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.},
