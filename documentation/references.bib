As much as the data and understanding allow, this simulation has a conceptual basis. Changes in the state of the simulated forest are a function of the present state plus random components. The program predicts a peak standing crop for the forest approximately 200 years following clearcutting, with a relatively stable, but fluctuating, species composition at subsequent periods. Designed to be used in the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study, the program provides output in a form compatible with the original vegetation survey of that study and allows a flexible interaction between the user and the simulator.},

	abstract = {To assess the impacts of climate change on vegetation from stand to global scales, models of forest dynamics that include tree demography are needed. Such models are now available for 50 years, but the currently existing diversity of model formulations and its evolution over time are poorly documented. This hampers systematic assessments of structural uncertainties in model-based studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of 28 models, focusing on models that were used in the past five years for climate change studies. We defined 52 model attributes in five groups (basic assumptions, growth, regeneration, mortality and soil moisture) and characterized each model according to these attributes. Analyses of model complexity and diversity included hierarchical cluster analysis and redundancy analysis. Model complexity evolved considerably over the past 50 years. Increases in complexity were largest for growth processes, while complexity of modelled establishment processes increased only moderately. Model diversity was lowest at the global scale, and highest at the landscape scale. We identified five distinct clusters of models, ranging from very simple models to models where specific attribute groups are rendered in a complex manner and models that feature high complexity across all attributes. Most models in use today are not balanced in the level of complexity with which they represent different processes. This is the result of different model purposes, but also reflects legacies in model code, modelers' preferences, and the ‘prevailing spirit of the epoch’. The lack of firm theories, laws and ‘first principles’ in ecology provides high degrees of freedom in model development, but also results in high responsibilities for model developers and the need for rigorous model evaluation. Synthesis. The currently available model diversity is beneficial: convergence in simulations of structurally different models indicates robust projections, while convergence of similar models may convey a false sense of certainty. The existing model diversity—with the exception of global models—can be exploited for improved projections based on multiple models. We strongly recommend balanced further developments of forest models that should particularly focus on establishment and mortality processes, in order to provide robust information for decisions in ecosystem management and policymaking.},

	abstract = {In times of rapid global change, anticipating vegetation changes and assessing their impacts is of key relevance to managers and policy makers. Yet, predicting vegetation dynamics often suffers from an inherent scale mismatch, with abundant data and process understanding being available at a fine spatial grain, but the relevance for decision-making is increasing with spatial extent. We present a novel approach for scaling vegetation dynamics ({SVD}), using deep learning to predict vegetation transitions. Vegetation is discretized into a large number (103–106) of potential states based on its structure, composition and functioning. Transition probabilities between states are estimated via a deep neural network ({DNN}) trained on observed or simulated vegetation transitions in combination with environmental variables. The impact of vegetation transitions on important ecological indicators is quantified by probabilistically linking attributes such as carbon storage and biodiversity to vegetation states. Here, we describe the {SVD} approach and present results of applying the framework in a meta-modelling context. We trained a {DNN} using simulations of a process-based forest landscape model for a complex mountain forest landscape under different climate scenarios. Subsequently, we evaluated the ability of {SVD} to project long-term vegetation dynamics and the resulting changes in forest carbon storage and biodiversity. {SVD} captured spatial (e.g. elevational gradients) and temporal (e.g. species succession) patterns of vegetation dynamics well, and responded realistically to changing environmental conditions. In addition, we tested the computational efficiency of the approach, highlighting the utility of {SVD} for country- to continental scale applications. {SVD} is the—to our knowledge—first vegetation model harnessing deep neural networks. The approach has high predictive accuracy and is able to generalize well beyond training data. {SVD} was designed to run on widely available input data (e.g. vegetation states defined from remote sensing, gridded global climate datasets) and exceeds the computational performance of currently available highly optimized landscape models by three to four orders of magnitude. We conclude that {SVD} is a promising approach for combining detailed process knowledge on fine-grained ecosystem processes with the increasingly available big ecological datasets for improved large-scale projections of vegetation dynamics.},

	abstract = {Geographically extensive forest inventories, such as the {USDA} Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis ({FIA}) program, contain millions of individual tree growth and mortality records that could be used to develop broad-scale models of forest dynamics. A limitation of inventory data, however, is that individual-level measurements of light (L) and other environmental factors are typically absent. Thus, inventory data alone cannot be used to parameterize mechanistic models of forest dynamics in which individual performance depends on light, water, nutrients, etc. To overcome this limitation, we developed methods to estimate species-specific parameters (θG) relating sapling growth (G) to L using data sets in which G, but not L, is observed for each sapling. Our approach involves: (1) using calibration data that we collected in both eastern and western North America to quantify the probability that saplings receive different amounts of light, conditional on covariates x that can be obtained from inventory data (e.g., sapling crown class and neighborhood crowding); and (2) combining these probability distributions with observed G and x to estimate θG using Bayesian computational methods. Here, we present a test case using a data set in which G, L, and x were observed for saplings of nine species. This test data set allowed us to compare estimates of θG obtained from the standard approach (where G and L are observed for each sapling) to our method (where G and x, but not L, are observed). For all species, estimates of θG obtained from analyses with and without observed L were similar. This suggests that our approach should be useful for estimating light-dependent growth functions from inventory data that lack direct measurements of L. Our approach could be extended to estimate parameters relating sapling mortality to L from inventory data, as well as to deal with uncertainty in other resources (e.g., water or nutrients) or environmental factors (e.g., temperature).},

	abstract = {Abstract. Canopy radiative transfer is the primary mechanism by which models relate vegetation composition and state to the surface energy balance, which is important to light- and temperature-sensitive plant processes as well as understanding land–atmosphere feedbacks.
In addition, certain parameters (e.g., specific leaf area, {SLA}) that have an outsized influence on vegetation model behavior can be constrained by observations of shortwave reflectance, thus reducing model predictive uncertainty.
Importantly, calibrating against radiative transfer outputs allows models to directly use remote sensing reflectance products without relying on highly derived products (such as {MODIS} leaf area index) whose assumptions may be incompatible with the target vegetation model and whose uncertainties are usually not well quantified.
Here, we created the {EDR} model by coupling the two-stream representation of canopy radiative transfer in the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 ({ED}2) with a leaf radiative transfer model ({PROSPECT}-5) and a simple soil reflectance model to predict full-range, high-spectral-resolution surface reflectance that is dependent on the underlying {ED}2 model state.
We then calibrated this model against estimates of hemispherical reflectance (corrected for directional effects) from the {NASA} Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer ({AVIRIS}) and survey data from 54 temperate forest plots in the northeastern United States.
The calibration significantly reduced uncertainty in model parameters related to leaf biochemistry and morphology and canopy structure for five plant functional types.
Using a single common set of parameters across all sites, the calibrated model was able to accurately reproduce surface reflectance for sites with highly varied forest composition and structure.
However, the calibrated model's predictions of leaf area index ({LAI}) were less robust, capturing only 46 \% of the variability in the observations.
Comparing the {ED}2 radiative transfer model with another two-stream soil–leaf–canopy radiative transfer model commonly used in remote sensing studies ({PRO}4SAIL) illustrated structural errors in the {ED}2 representation of direct radiation backscatter that resulted in systematic underestimation of reflectance.
In addition, we also highlight that, to directly compare with a two-stream radiative transfer model like {EDR}, we had to perform an additional processing step to convert the directional reflectance estimates of {AVIRIS} to hemispherical reflectance (also known as “albedo”).
In future work, we recommend that vegetation models add the capability to predict directional reflectance, to allow them to more directly assimilate a wide range of airborne and satellite reflectance products.
We ultimately conclude that despite these challenges, using dynamic vegetation models to predict surface reflectance is a promising avenue for model calibration and validation using remote sensing data.},

The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.},
