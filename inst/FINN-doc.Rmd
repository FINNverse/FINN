## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
f1 = function(dbh) ((200-dbh) / 200)^3
dbh = seq(0,200,0.01)
plot(dbh, f1(dbh))
plot(dbh, f1(dbh))


plot(dbh, 4*(f1(dbh)^2))
dbh = 1
for(t in 1:200){
  dbh = c(dbh, dbh[t] + f1(dbh[t])*4)
}
plot(1:201, dbh)
max(dbh)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
